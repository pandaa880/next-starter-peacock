Hello, World!

I am starting my writing journey from today. I wish I can help you and learn from you by sharing my knowledge.

I am a Frontend Engineer by profession and I am a self taught. Till now I have learned from internet as much as I can and I think it is time to give back to the community. I hope my future articles will help you ðŸ¤ž. I plan to write about Frontend in general and a little bit about Rust as well. Let's see how this goes.

I want to thank you [Victor Ofoegbu](https://github.com/vickOnRails) for creating and sharing this beautiful [starter pack](https://github.com/vickOnRails/next-starter-peacock). As I am in the process of creating my personal site design I wanted to quickly setup something and I really like this starter pack that Victor made.

Thank you for reading. See you soon ! ðŸ˜€
